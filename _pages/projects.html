        C++ concepts.
    </li>

</ul>

<h3>Research Projects</h3>

<li><a href="http://www.gamecar.eu/">GamECAR</a>: Road transport is one of the major causes of the environmental
    pollution. In addition, road traffic injuries are a serious public health problem in the European Region, with huge
    social and financial adverse effects. A leading cause for both issues is aggressive driving.Driver’s style makes a
    difference in terms of fuel consumption, with a stretch up to 35 % between a calm and an aggressive one. Individuals
    can contribute in the reduction of CO2 emission associated to personal transportation by operating their vehicles
    more efficiently.To make this change more effective, GamECAR will put in place an innovative strategy building on
    Gamification.
</li>
<li><a href="http://gaia-project.eu/">GAIA</a>: GAIA (Green Awareness In Action) is a three year long, EU-funded H2020
    project made up of nine partners.
</li>
This project aims to promote positive behavioural changes within communities regarding energy consumption/awareness. GAIA activities consist of the gamification of real-time, IoT-enhanced energy consumption metrics in trial schools located in Italy, Greece and Sweden.</li>
<li><a href="http://organicity.eu/">Organicity</a>: OrganiCity is a platform for interaction between everyone in the
    city. Citizens, activists, researchers, businesses, city government – everyone in the city can contribute. Through
    workshops, meetups, conferences and events, and online via discussion boards and other platforms, social media and a
    growing set of online tools, you can get involved to highlight the ways you think smart technology can help make
    your city a better place to live, work and play.
</li>
<li><a href="https://amaxilatis.com/greenmindset.cti.gr">Greenmindset</a>: The project aims to implement the green
    concept for reducing the energy load on selected carriers of the Greek Ministry of Education as an initial pilot
    implementation on which to base further actions, which will cover the building of infrastructure. This pilot project
    was implemented in 48 school campuses and two buildings of CTI.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.spitfire-project.eu/">SPITFIRE</a>: Semantic-Service Provisioning for the Internet of Things
    using Future Internet Research by Experimentation. The project is funded as part of an ICT/FIRE European Union
    program.
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wisebed.eu/">WISEBED</a>: Wireless Sensor Network Testbed. The project is funded as part of an
    ICT/FIRE European Union program.
</li>
<li><a href="http://fronts.cti.gr/">FRONTS</a>: Foundations of Adaptive Networked Societies of Tiny Artefacts. The
    project is funded as part of an ICT/FET European Union program.
